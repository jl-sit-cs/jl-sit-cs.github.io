# Group 9 - Speciecs Identification 

Species are currently recorded manually and entered into a spreadsheet after being authenticated, often by a single individual. While this has been a fun and meaningful activity to share with family and friends, the process is tedious, inefficient, and prone to error. To improve this, we aim to streamline data entry, reduce manual workload, and maintain expert validation. We also plan to expand the role of citizen recorders year-round through the use of the iNaturalist app.
